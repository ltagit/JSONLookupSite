# JSONLookupSite
This project explored JSON parsing. Given a buildinglist.json file with image data, building info, and rankings, 
the info was converted into a table with the required info displayed.

Error cases, such as incorrect file names and blank entries were caught as alerts to the user.

enter buildinglist.json at 
http://lanceaas.freevar.com/5uzz56uboqhw4.html

for demo.
